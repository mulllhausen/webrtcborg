Resistance is futile ;)

Note: this repo is a work in progress

## Philosophy

### Transparency
WebRTC is complicated technology, so clear feedback must always be given to
users explaining their level of privacy and security.

### Developer Friendly
Keep code as simple as possible with plenty of comments to enable new developers
to easily join. Use vartiable names that clearly explain functionality even if
they end up being longer this way.

### Antifragile
All components of the project must be decentralized. Without a central point of
failure the network will withstand attackers.

### Self Control Only
Each user must have full control over their own node, and no control over any
other nodes.
